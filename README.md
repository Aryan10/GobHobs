# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è GobHobs - The Goblin Data Extractor üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**Welcome to GobHobs, the goblin-themed data extraction tool!** In the world of goblins, there‚Äôs one thing they excel at‚Äîlooting and extracting valuable information. Inspired by their relentless pursuit of treasures, **GobHobs** is here to help you ‚Äúextract‚Äù data from multiple sources and organize it in ways only a goblin would dream of!

### The Story of GobHobs:
Once upon a time, a mischievous goblin stumbled upon an ancient library filled with data. From legal PDFs to phone records and web search results, it was all too much for even the greediest goblin to process. But this goblin was no ordinary thief‚Äîhe wanted **all the data** and to process it intelligently, organizing it for future "plunders."

Thus, **GobHobs** was born‚Äîa magical tool that allows you to:
1. Extract and structure data from **PDFs** (loot the precious structured data).
2. Search and manage **phone records** (sneaky, sneaky goblin-style investigation).
3. **Scrape the web** and organize it based on your needs (goblin-grade web-looting).

But there‚Äôs a twist‚Äîthe goblin leaves some work for **you** to do! You can implement the brains of the goblin's operations in either **Python (.py)** or **JavaScript (.js)**. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure
**GobHobs** is divided into three microservices:
1. **PDF Extractor**: Extract structured data from PDF files and convert it into JSON format.
2. **Phone Records**: Manage and search phone records by converting CSV data into JSON and performing complex searches.
3. **Web Scraping**: Scrape data from web pages and order it based on relevance or user-defined criteria.

Each microservice provides the option to implement functionality in either **Python (.py)** or **JavaScript (.js)**, giving you the freedom to choose based on your expertise.

## üéØ What You Need to Do
### Implement the following microservices:
1. **PDF Extractor**:
   - Extract tables, key-value pairs, or any structured data from a PDF file.
   - Save the data as a JSON file.
   - You can implement this in either `extractfrompdf.py` or `extractfrompdf.js`.

2. **Phone Records**:
   - Convert phone records from CSV format to JSON.
   - Implement a smart search function to find exact and approximate matches (goblins love finding hidden treasures).
   - You can implement this in `searchrecords.py` or `searchrecords.js`.

3. **Web Scraping**:
   - Scrape the web based on a query provided by the user.
   - Implement functionality to order and rank the results.
   - You can implement this in `ordering.py` or `ordering.js`.

## üíª How to Use GobHobs
To unleash the goblin magic, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have both **Python** and **Node.js** installed on your system. Then, install the necessary Python dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2.  Run the Frontend CLI
Navigate to the frontend folder and run the Goblin command-line interface (CLI) using:

```bash
cd frontend
python shell_script.py
```

### 3. Run the backend file 
Navigate to the backend directory and run the backend file 

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

### 4. using the frontend cli application
You can use the ferontend cli using the commands by typing a help keyword and seeing the command and its usage

## üéâ All the Best & Happy Coding! üéâ

Thank you for joining the **GobHobs** adventure! We hope you enjoy working on this project as much as the goblins enjoy looting and extracting data.

Whether you're mastering the art of **PDF extraction**, building intelligent **search algorithms** for phone records, or crafting the perfect **web scraping and ranking** logic, the goblins are always watching your progress with excitement. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

Remember, this project is all about improving your skills in:
- Data extraction.
- Algorithm building.
- Smart searching.
- Web scraping.

Feel free to customize, improve, and make this project your own! The goblins can‚Äôt wait to see what you‚Äôll do next.

**Good luck, and happy coding!** üíªüí°üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
